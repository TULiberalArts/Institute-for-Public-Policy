## The Pennsylvania Capital Semester
![PA House Chamber]({{site.baseurl}}/media/PAHouseChamber_001.jpeg){:.img-right}
Started in fall 2009, The Institute for Public Affairs sponsors an internship semester each fall and spring semester in Harrisburg in association with Templeâ€™s [Harrisburg campus](http://www.temple.edu/harrisburg/). Students have the opportunity to explore government affairs, policymaking and implementation first-hand while being full-time students and staying on track to graduation. Applications are being accepted on a rolling basis. We encourage students from schools other than Temple University to apply as well. Watch a video on the program below.

## The Internship
- This program is open to students of any major and college at Temple University as well as students of other colleges or universities, and is modeled on a study abroad placement. Students will experience total immersion in state institutions and state politics in Harrisburg.
- Past students in the program were majors in: Economics, Finance, Social Work, Public Relations, Journalism, Broadcast Journalism, Criminal Justice, Sociology, Philosophy, and Political Science, but students from any major can apply.
Placements include executive branch agencies, the state legislature, and government related private and non-profit employers. Placements are also individualized to each student, as Temple establishes the initial contacts and sets up interviews, if need be. See a partial list of [internship placement options](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/PACapitalSemesterInternshipSites.pdf).
- Some internships are paid, but some are not. Given the current budget crisis, the state has suspended most paid internships. Still, there are some paid internships out there.
- Depending on placement, interns will work on specific legislation, legislative analysis, constituent service, policy research, organizing meetings, public relations, grassroots campaigns, special events, press releases, writing newsletters, economic development projects, writing news stories, reporting on legislative hearings, lobbying, advocacy for particular policies/groups, information systems or web design & maintenance, or placement in the Capitol newsroom.

- Internships might involve outside activities, such as fundraisers, press conferences, receptions and other special events.
- Take a look at the essential Guide to Interning in Harrisburg to get an idea of life as an intern in the program.
- Enrollment in the program includes a $1500 award to Temple students to be received after the first three weeks of the internship.
